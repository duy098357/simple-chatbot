# StratoBridge Lending Chatbot

A lightweight, intent-based chatbot built in **Python (Flask)** for [stratolending.com](https://www.stratolending.com).  
It greets users, answers common mortgage-related questions, and hands off to a live agent or contact form when needed.  
Easily deployable to **Render**, **Railway**, or **AWS Lambda**, and embeddable in a **Wix site** via a simple HTML snippet.
